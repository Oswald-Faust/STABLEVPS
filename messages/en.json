    "items": {
      "q1": {
        "question": "How does a VPS work for trading?",
        "answer": "A VPS (Virtual Private Server) is a virtual server that runs 24/7 in the cloud. You connect remotely via RDP (Remote Desktop) to a Windows desktop where you install your trading platforms. Even if your PC is off, the VPS keeps running your EAs and bots."
      },
      "q2": {
        "question": "Which location should I choose?",
        "answer": "Choose the location closest to your broker's servers, not to you. For most European Forex brokers, we recommend London or Amsterdam. For US brokers, New York is ideal. This minimizes latency and optimizes order execution."
      },
      "q3": {
        "question": "Which plan is right for me?",
        "answer": "It depends on how many platforms you want to run: Basic (1-3 platforms) for beginners, Prime (3-6 platforms) for active traders, Pro (6-10+ platforms) for professionals. If you use resource-intensive EAs, choose a higher plan."
      },
      "q4": {
        "question": "What payment methods do you accept?",
        "answer": "We accept Visa, Mastercard, PayPal and cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, USDT). All payments are secure and you receive an automatic invoice for each transaction."
      },
      "q5": {
        "question": "What is latency and why is it important?",
        "answer": "Latency is the time it takes for a signal to go from your VPS to your broker's server. Low latency (<5ms) means your orders are executed faster, which is crucial for scalping and high-frequency EAs. Our infrastructure is optimized to offer minimal latency."
      },
      "q6": {
        "question": "How many platforms can I run?",
        "answer": "It depends on your plan: Basic allows 1-3 platforms, Prime 3-6 platforms, and Pro 6-10+ platforms. These figures are recommendations based on allocated resources. You can install more, but performance may be impacted."
      },
      "q7": {
        "question": "From which devices can I access my VPS?",
        "answer": "You can connect from any device: Windows PC, Mac, iPad/Android tablet, or even smartphone. All you need is an RDP app (free) and an internet connection."
      },
      "q8": {
        "question": "What is your refund policy?",
        "answer": "We offer a 14-day money-back guarantee. If you're not satisfied with our service for any reason, contact our support and we'll refund you in full, no questions asked."
